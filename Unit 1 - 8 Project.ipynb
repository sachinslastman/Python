    "In this project, you will be creating a number guessing game.  There are two parts to this project - a BASE version and a BONUS version.  The game will work as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>BASE Game Version - Maximum Score 85%</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The computer will generate a random number between 1 and 10 (this code is provided).\n",
    "- You code will ask the user for a guess.\n",
    "- If the user guesses correctly, the code will print a relevant response.\n",
    "- If the user guesses incorrectly, the program will print a response ask for a new guess.\n",
    "- This will continue until the user guesses correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>BONUS Game Version - Maximum Score 100%</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The BASE game will be augmented so that the random number is between 1 and 100.\n",
    "- You will ask the user for a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard).\n",
    "- Depending on their selection, the user has 5, 9, 15 guesses to get it right.\n",
    "- After each guess, the program will provide the user with feedback if they were \"too high\" or \"too low\".\n",
    "- Your program will keep track of how many guesses the user has made.\n",
    "- The program will end if the maximum number of guesses for that diffculty has been exceeded.\n",
    "- If this happens the program will print an appropriate message.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Requirements</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- You must use a `while` loop\n",
    "- You must use the `break` keyword\n",
    "- Your user guess input and any casting of that variable must occur in a `try` block\n",
    "- If the `try` block raises an error, your loop should continue to ask the user for a guess\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Hints</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Get the user input inside of the loop\n",
    "- What is the type of the random number and what is the type of the guess? Must the the same to compare.\n",
    "- Don't forget to stop the loop when the user answers correctly\n"
